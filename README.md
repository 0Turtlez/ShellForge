# Shell Forge
A Minecraft mod manager built with Go. Originally started as a simple scraping project to build the best mod pack, it’s now evolving into a full-fledged mod manager.

This CLI tool leverages the speed of Go to handle large mod collections efficiently. Currently, it’s in a CLI-only state, with plans for a full UI in the future.
